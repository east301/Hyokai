Table View build script for Windows
===================================

Run "build.bat" to build TableView.exe for windows.  You have to
install Qt SDK with Visual Studio and run build.bat in Qt command
prompt.  If you want to use Qt SDK with MinGW, please replace "nmake"
with "make" in build.bat

We recommend to use static build of Qt, because it is difficult to put
DLLs correcly.
